# New Year’s Resolutions Tracker — SheCodes.io Challenge 

## Tech stack:  
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript (single file)  

## Description:   
This project was built for the SheCodes.io January 2025 New Year’s Resolutions Challenge. The goal was to create a fun landing page to showcase my personal resolutions for the year — but I ended up turning it into a fully interactive goal-tracking app that I actually use every day.  

Everything is coded in a single HTML file with embedded CSS and JavaScript. While it’s desktop-only and intentionally kept simple, it’s become a tool I keep open in a browser tab to stay motivated and track progress on my goals throughout the year.  

## Key Features:  
- Goal 1: Read 15 books → A form to add finished books (title, rating, comments, cover image). Completed books appear in a styled card list, while a progress bar fills as I get closer to my 15-book goal.  
- Goal 2: Work out 100 times → A grid of 100 colorful squares that I fill in as I work out. Each workout also gets logged in a notes list (e.g. “Played tennis,” “Leg day”), helping me track both progress and variety.  
- Goal 3: Spend less money → A counter that tracks “no-spend days.” Each day saved fills a gradient jar with color, giving me a visual reward for better habits.  
- Goal 4: Mood tracker → A yearly calendar where I can record my daily mood with one of six emojis. Over time, the tracker gives me insight into emotional patterns and balance.
